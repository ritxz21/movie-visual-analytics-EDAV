Our exploration highlights several key insights:

(1) the pandemic significantly changed how movies were produced, released, and rated, but the types of stories told remained surprisingly stable, with the dominant genres (Drama, Comedy, Action) maintaining nearly identical shares before, during, and after COVID. 

(2) Audience engagement declined sharply during the pandemic and did not fully recover, as seen in lower vote counts, reflecting a more fragmented attention landscape. 

(3) The geography of film production shifted—India rose into the top three producing regions while Great Britain dropped out. 

(4) Despite theater closures, the global reach of movies actually increased post-2020, driven by streaming platforms enabling films to release in more regions. 

(5) Thriller and Documentary genres, gained noticeable momentum during COVID. 

Our analysis is limited by IMDb’s inherent biases, such as inconsistent metadata, uneven rating counts, and survivorship effects. Future work could incorporate streaming data, box-office numbers, or review text analysis to provide a richer understanding of how film production and consumption are evolving.
