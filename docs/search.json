    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis project analyzes IMDB movie data downloaded directly from the public dataset.\nOver the past few years, the movie world has changed a lot, streaming services took off, and then COVID turned everything upside down. People started watching films in new ways, and movies began reaching audiences across the globe like never before.\nThis project dives into IMDb data on theatrical and feature films to uncover what’s really happening. It explores how ratings have shifted over the decades, how audience engagement changed before, during, and after the pandemic, whether genre tastes are getting more similar worldwide, and how far films now travel to different countries. Overall, it highlights the big trends like the massive boost in global reach thanks to streaming, while showing that local preferences still hold strong.\nNavigate using the sidebar to see the full analysis.",

To get a clearer picture of movie quality without this bias, we’ll instead look at pre-COVID, during-COVID, and post-COVID films later on and explore how the pandemic affected movie releases.\nNext, we look at the top genres.

We also see that longer documentaries consistently earn higher ratings, while genres like Horror, Mystery, Thriller, and Action show a noticeable dip in ratings for films around the 60-minute mark.\n\n\n3.0.2 Moving on, let’s unpack what the IMDb data is telling us about the film world before, during, and after COVID.\n\n\nCode\n# Define COVID periods\nmovies_clean &lt;- movies_clean |&gt;\n  mutate(period = case_when(\n    startYear &lt; 2020 ~ \"Pre-COVID\",\n    startYear %in% 2020:2021 ~ \"During COVID\",\n    startYear &gt;= 2022 ~ \"Post-COVID\"\n  ))\n\n\nWe measured engagement via average IMDb votes (proxy for viewership interest) and number of releases per period.\n\n\nCode\n# Plot: Average Votes by COVID Period (Engagement Proxy)\n\nengagement_summary &lt;- movies_clean |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(period)) |&gt;\n  group_by(period) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    avg_votes   = mean(imdb_votes, na.rm = TRUE),\n    movie_count = n(),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  # order periods: pre-covid -&gt; during covid -&gt; post-covid\n  mutate(\n    period = factor(\n      period,\n      levels = c(\"Pre-COVID\", \"During COVID\", \"Post-COVID\")\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(engagement_summary,\n                          aes(x = period, y = avg_votes)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#555555\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(\"n = \", movie_count)),\n            vjust = -0.4, size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Average IMDb Votes per Movie by COVID Period\",\n    subtitle = \"Bar height: average votes (engagement) • Labels: number of movies\",\n    x        = \"Period\",\n    y        = \"Average IMDb Votes\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 11) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMovie engagement drops sharply during COVID, likely due to theatre closures and reduced global releases.

Overall release volumes, however, dropped sharply during the pandemic and have not returned to pre-COVID levels.Great Britain took a hit post-covid while USA and Canada maintained their top positions.\n\n\nCode\nrating_region_period &lt;- movies_with_regions |&gt;\n  filter(region %in% top_regions) |&gt;\n  group_by(period, region) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    avg_rating = mean(imdb_rating, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    period = factor(period, levels = c(\"Pre-COVID\", \"During COVID\", \"Post-COVID\")),\n    region_reordered = reorder_within(region, -avg_rating, period)\n  )\n\nggplot(rating_region_period,\n       aes(x = region_reordered, y = avg_rating)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"grey40\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ period, scales = \"free_x\") +\n  scale_x_reordered() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average IMDb Ratings by Region Across COVID Periods\",\n    subtitle = \"Regions ordered by average rating within each period\",\n    x = \"Region\",\n    y = \"Average IMDb Rating\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, India sees a noticeable dip in average ratings during COVID but rebounds strongly afterward, becoming the highest-rated region post-COVID. Japan, on the other hand, maintains high ratings through COVID but experiences a slight decline in the post-COVID period.\nNext, we want to understand if the pandemic had an effect on the global reach of movies, We use number of release regions per movie as a proxy for global reach. Share of movies with &gt;5 regions increased post-2020.\n\n\nCode\n# Plot: Average Number of Release Regions by COVID Period\nakas_count &lt;- akas |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(region)) |&gt;  # Exclude original (\\N)\n  group_by(titleId) |&gt;\n  summarise(num_regions = n_distinct(region, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nmovies_clean &lt;- movies_clean |&gt;\n  left_join(akas_count, by = c(\"tconst\" = \"titleId\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(num_regions = if_else(is.na(num_regions), 0L, num_regions))\n\nglobal_reach_plot &lt;- movies_clean |&gt;\n  mutate(period = factor(period,\n                         levels = c(\"Pre-COVID\", \"During COVID\", \"Post-COVID\"))) |&gt;\n  group_by(period) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_regions = mean(num_regions, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = period, y = avg_regions, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#2ca02c\", linewidth = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#2ca02c\", size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Number of Release Regions per Movie by COVID Period\",\n    x = \"Period\",\n    y = \"Average Regions\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\nglobal_reach_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that even though theatres were closed down, the number of regions movies spread to rose significantly, probably due to the increased popularity of global streaming platforms.\nAt first glance it looks like globalization slowed, but the opposite could be true for blockbuster and mid-tier films. The slight dip in the overall average could be driven by an explosion of hyper-local, micro-budget movies that rarely leave their home country.\nMeanwhile, any film with decent marketing muscle now routinely lands in 20–50+ territories thanks to Netflix, Prime, Disney+, etc. In short: the ceiling got much higher even if the floor stayed low.\nFinally, we try to understand the change in Genre preferences during and after pandemic, if the pandemic had any effect on it.\n\n\nCode\ntop_genres &lt;- movies_clean |&gt;\n  unnest(genres_list) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(genres_list)) |&gt;\n  count(genres_list, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 8) |&gt;\n  pull(genres_list)\n\n# 2.

What did shift, however, was a noticeable rise in Thrillers and Documentaries (also notable that True-Crime Documentaries gained popularity during the Pandemic). In other words, the pandemic changed where movies were released and how audiences engaged with them, but not what kinds of stories the industry continued to produce.",

    "text": "Our exploration highlights several key insights:\n\nthe pandemic significantly changed how movies were produced, released, and rated, but the types of stories told remained surprisingly stable, with the dominant genres (Drama, Comedy, Action) maintaining nearly identical shares before, during, and after COVID.\nAudience engagement declined sharply during the pandemic and did not fully recover, as seen in lower vote counts, reflecting a more fragmented attention landscape.\nThe geography of film production shifted—India rose into the top three producing regions while Great Britain dropped out.\nDespite theater closures, the global reach of movies actually increased post-2020, driven by streaming platforms enabling films to release in more regions.\nThriller and Documentary genres, gained noticeable momentum during COVID.\n\nOur analysis is limited by IMDb’s inherent biases, such as inconsistent metadata, uneven rating counts, and survivorship effects. Future work could incorporate streaming data, box-office numbers, or review text analysis to provide a richer understanding of how film production and consumption are evolving.\n\n4.0.1 Thank you",
