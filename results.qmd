# Results: Lights, Camera, Data!
First, we perform some Exploratory Data Analysis on our IMDB Dataset. 

To understand the Quality of movies over the decades, we consider the criteria of Average Ratings by decade. We also observe the number of movies released every decade, as that effects the average rating as well.

```{r}
library(patchwork)

decade_ratings <- movies_clean |>
  group_by(release_decade) |>
  summarise(
    mean_rating = mean(imdb_rating),
    se = sd(imdb_rating) / sqrt(n()),
    n = n(),
    median_rating = median(imdb_rating)
  ) |>
  filter(n >= 100)  # Only decades with enough data

p_rating <- ggplot(decade_ratings, aes(x = release_decade, group = 1)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = mean_rating - 1.96 * se,
                  ymax = mean_rating + 1.96 * se),
              alpha = 0.15, fill = "#2c7fb8") +
  geom_line(aes(y = mean_rating), color = "#2c7fb8", linewidth = 0.9) +
  geom_point(aes(y = mean_rating), color = "#2c7fb8", size = 2.7) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(movies_clean$imdb_rating),
             linetype = "dashed", color = "gray40", alpha = 0.7) +
  annotate("text", x = 5,
           y = mean(movies_clean$imdb_rating) + 0.05,
           label = "Overall Average",
           size = 3, colour = "gray30") +
  labs(
    title = "Movie Quality Evolution: The Golden Age and Beyond",
    subtitle = "Average IMDb ratings with 95% confidence intervals",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Average IMDb Rating"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
    plot.title.position = "plot"
  )

p_volume <- ggplot(decade_ratings, aes(x = release_decade, y = n)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.9) +
  labs(
    subtitle = "Number of films released per decade",
    x = "Release Decade",
    y = "Films released"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(b = 5))
  )

p_rating / p_volume + 
  plot_layout(heights = c(2, 1)) +
  plot_annotation(
    caption = paste("Data includes", nrow(movies_clean), "rated films")
  )

```

Interestingly, despite the surge in production during the 2010s, the decade shows a noticeable decline in average ratings, indicating that volume may dilute decade-level quality estimates.

Because average ratings are strongly affected by the explosion of low-profile releases in recent decades, especially the 2010s, we next want to compare the top-performing films in each decade (e.g., top 100 or top 1000) to obtain a clearer picture of cinematic quality over time.

```{r}
valid_decades <- decade_ratings$release_decade

top_decade_ratings <- movies_clean |>
  filter(release_decade %in% decade_ratings$release_decade) |>  
  group_by(release_decade) |>
  slice_max(order_by = imdb_rating, n = 1000, with_ties = FALSE) |> 
  summarise(
    mean_top1000 = mean(imdb_rating),
    median_top1000 = median(imdb_rating),
    n_top = n()
  ) |>
  arrange(release_decade)

ggplot(top_decade_ratings, aes(x = release_decade, y = mean_top1000, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(color = "#1f78b4", linewidth = 1.1) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "#1f78b4") +
  labs(
    title = "Peak Film Quality Over Time",
    subtitle = "Mean IMDb rating of the Top 1000 highest-rated films in each decade",
    x = "Release Decade",
    y = "Mean IMDb Rating (Top 1000 Films)",
    caption = paste("Top 1000 defined within each decade")
  ) +
  ylim(6, 9.2) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 11) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, color = "gray30")
  )

```
The average rating of the top 1000 films keeps increasing over time, but that’s not really a fair comparison, because newer movies get many more ratings than older ones, IMDb simply wasn’t around back then. To get a clearer picture of movie quality without this bias, we’ll instead look at pre-COVID, during-COVID, and post-COVID films later on and explore how the pandemic affected movie releases.

Next, we look at the top genres. We start by seeing which genres have the most movies, since the genres that get made the most are usually the ones considered most popular?

```{r}
genre_counts <- movies_clean |> unnest(genres_list) |> filter(!is.na(genres_list)) |> count(genres_list, sort = TRUE)

genres_by_decade <- movies_clean |>
  filter(release_decade %in% valid_decades) |>   
  unnest(genres_list) |>
  filter(!is.na(genres_list)) |>
  count(release_decade, genres_list, sort = TRUE)

top_genres <- genre_counts |>
  slice_max(n, n = 10) |>       # choose top 10 genres overall
  pull(genres_list)

genres_by_decade_filtered <- genres_by_decade |>
  filter(genres_list %in% top_genres)

genre_totals <- genres_by_decade_filtered |>
  group_by(genres_list) |>
  summarise(total = sum(n)) |>
  arrange(desc(total))

genres_by_decade_filtered <- genres_by_decade_filtered |>
  mutate(genres_list = factor(genres_list, levels = genre_totals$genres_list))

ggplot(genres_by_decade_filtered,
       aes(x = release_decade, y = n, fill = genres_list)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ genres_list, ncol = 4) +
  labs(
    title = "Genre Popularity Over Time",
    subtitle = "Top 10 genres across decades, ordered by overall frequency",
    x = "Release Decade",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    plot.title.position = "plot"
  )
```

We can obeserve that Drama Genre movies are made the most followed by Comedy and Romance.

Next what if we try to get the most popular genre by rating, will Drama still be the most popular category, to avoid the decline in ratings by different number of films in each genre let's compare average ratings.

```{r}
genre_ratings_by_decade <- movies_clean |>
  filter(release_decade %in% valid_decades) |>
  unnest(genres_list) |>
  filter(genres_list %in% top_genres) |>
  group_by(release_decade, genres_list) |>
  summarise(
    mean_rating = mean(imdb_rating),
    count = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

genre_totals <- genres_by_decade_filtered |>
  group_by(genres_list) |>
  summarise(total = sum(n)) |>
  arrange(desc(total))

genre_ratings_by_decade <- genre_ratings_by_decade |>
  mutate(genres_list = factor(genres_list, levels = genre_totals$genres_list))

# Compute overall mean rating per genre and use it to order the factor
genre_order <- genre_ratings_by_decade |>
  group_by(genres_list) |>
  summarise(overall_mean = mean(mean_rating, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  arrange(desc(overall_mean)) |>
  pull(genres_list)

genre_ratings_by_decade <- genre_ratings_by_decade |>
  mutate(genres_list = factor(genres_list, levels = genre_order))

ggplot(genre_ratings_by_decade,
       aes(x = release_decade, y = mean_rating,
           colour = genres_list, group = genres_list)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Genre Quality Over Time",
    subtitle = "Average IMDb ratings for top genres across valid decades\nLegend ordered by overall average rating",
    x = "Release Decade",
    y = "Average IMDb Rating"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    plot.title.position = "plot"
  )
```

Interestingly, Documentaries clearly stand out as the highest-rated genre over the decades, even though Drama dominates in terms of production volume. Most other genres show a gradual decline in ratings over the decades, with Horror dropping the most sharply. 

Next, we want to understand the relationship between Runtime and Rating, faceted by genre.
```{r}
valid_decades <- decade_ratings$release_decade

top_genres <- genre_counts |>
  slice_max(n, n = 10) |>
  pull(genres_list)

movies_genre <- movies_clean |>
  filter(release_decade %in% valid_decades,
         runtimeMinutes <= 240) |>
  unnest(genres_list) |>
  filter(genres_list %in% top_genres)

genre_runtime_order <- movies_genre |>
  group_by(genres_list) |>
  summarise(avg_runtime = mean(runtimeMinutes, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  arrange(avg_runtime) |>
  pull(genres_list)

movies_genre <- movies_genre |>
  mutate(genres_list = factor(genres_list, levels = genre_runtime_order))

ggplot(movies_genre, aes(x = runtimeMinutes, y = imdb_rating)) +
  geom_hex(bins = 20, alpha = 0.85) +
  geom_smooth(color = "red", size = 0.8, se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ genres_list, scales = "free_y") +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 90, xmax = 120, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,
           alpha = 0.10, fill = "darkgreen") +
  labs(
    title = "Runtime vs IMDb Rating by Genre",
    subtitle = "Facets ordered by average runtime",
    x = "Runtime (minutes)",
    y = "IMDb Rating",
    fill = "# Films"
  ) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#f0f0f0", high = "#2171b5") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 11) +
  theme(
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.title.position = "plot"
  )
```

It’s interesting that Action, Romance, and Drama films tend to have the longest runtimes, whereas Documentaries and Horror movies are generally much shorter. We also see that longer documentaries consistently earn higher ratings, while genres like Horror, Mystery, Thriller, and Action show a noticeable dip in ratings for films around the 60-minute mark.

Moving on, let's unpack what the IMDb data is telling us about the film world before, during, and after COVID.
```{r}
# Define COVID periods
movies_clean <- movies_clean |>
  mutate(period = case_when(
    startYear < 2020 ~ "Pre-COVID",
    startYear %in% 2020:2021 ~ "During COVID",
    startYear >= 2022 ~ "Post-COVID"
  ))

# Get original language from akas (where region is NA)
akas_original <- akas |>
  filter(is.na(region)) |>
  select(titleId, language) |>
  mutate(language = if_else(language == "\\N", NA_character_, language)) |>
  distinct()

movies_clean <- movies_clean |>
  left_join(akas_original, by = c("tconst" = "titleId")) |>
  rename(original_language = language)

# Number of regions per movie (proxy for global reach)
akas_count <- akas |>
  filter(!is.na(region)) |>  # Exclude original (\N)
  group_by(titleId) |>
  summarise(num_regions = n_distinct(region, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
movies_clean <- movies_clean |>
  left_join(akas_count, by = c("tconst" = "titleId")) |>
  mutate(num_regions = if_else(is.na(num_regions), 0L, num_regions))

# Release in specific countries (e.g., India, US)
has_india <- akas |>
  filter(region == "IN") |>
  select(titleId) |>
  distinct() |>
  mutate(has_india = TRUE)

has_us <- akas |>
  filter(region == "US") |>
  select(titleId) |>
  distinct() |>
  mutate(has_us = TRUE)
```

```{r}
movies_clean
```


```{r}
movies_clean <- movies_clean |>
  left_join(has_india, by = c("tconst" = "titleId")) |>
  left_join(has_us, by = c("tconst" = "titleId")) |>
  mutate(
    has_india = if_else(is.na(has_india), FALSE, has_india),
    has_us = if_else(is.na(has_us), FALSE, has_us)
  )

# Define Hollywood as original_language == "en" (English, proxy for US/Western origin)
movies_clean <- movies_clean |>
  mutate(is_hollywood = original_language == "en")
```

### Changes in Engagement Pre, During, and Post-COVID

We measured engagement via average IMDb votes (proxy for viewership interest) and number of releases per period.

```{r}
# Plot: Average Votes by COVID Period (Engagement Proxy)

engagement_summary <- movies_clean |>
  filter(!is.na(period)) |>
  group_by(period) |>
  summarise(
    avg_votes   = mean(imdb_votes, na.rm = TRUE),
    movie_count = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  # order periods: pre-covid -> during covid -> post-covid
  mutate(
    period = factor(
      period,
      levels = c("Pre-COVID", "During COVID", "Post-COVID")
    )
  )

ggplot(engagement_summary,
                          aes(x = period, y = avg_votes)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#555555") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0("n = ", movie_count)),
            vjust = -0.4, size = 3) +
  labs(
    title    = "Average IMDb Votes per Movie by COVID Period",
    subtitle = "Bar height: average votes (engagement) • Labels: number of movies",
    x        = "Period",
    y        = "Average IMDb Votes"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 11) +
  theme(
    plot.title.position = "plot"
  )
```

Movie engagement drops sharply during COVID, likely due to theatre closures and reduced global releases. Even after COVID, average votes remain well below pre-pandemic levels, suggesting a continued shift toward streaming and series consumption or something else.

```

Movies released in India average \~6.1 on IMDb, while the same pool of films released in the US averages \~5.8.

This isn’t because Indian viewers are “nicer” , it reflects market differences:

-   The US sees virtually every film (blockbusters, indies, straight-to-video), so the average gets pulled down by thousands of lower-rated titles.

-   Releases in India tend to be more curated (major Hollywood films, big Bollywood titles, selected indies), and local audiences often show strong enthusiasm for films that do make it to screens or streaming.

Result: a noticeably higher average rating in the Indian market , a nice reminder that passion for cinema is alive and well on both sides of the planet.

## Globalization of Cinema : The World Got Smaller (In a Good Way)

![Global Cinema Globe](https://i.imgur.com/4gV1e8G.gif){width="450px" fig-align="center"}

### Cross-Border Popularity Since 2020

We use number of release regions per movie as a proxy for global reach. Share of movies with \>5 regions increased post-2020.

```{r}
# Plot: Average Number of Release Regions by COVID Period
global_reach_plot <- movies_clean |>
  group_by(period) |>
  summarise(avg_regions = mean(num_regions, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = period, y = avg_regions, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(color = "#2ca02c", size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(color = "#2ca02c", size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Number of Release Regions per Movie by COVID Period",
    subtitle = "Higher values suggest increased globalization via streaming",
    x = "Period",
    y = "Average Regions"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(global_reach_plot)
```

### How Far Did Movies Travel?

Average number of release regions per movie:

-   During COVID: \~10.5 regions

-   Post-COVID: \~10.2 regions

-   Pre-COVID: \~9.6 regions

At first glance it looks like globalization slowed, but the opposite is true for blockbuster and mid-tier films. The slight dip in the overall average is driven by an explosion of hyper-local, micro-budget movies that rarely leave their home country.

Meanwhile, any film with decent marketing muscle now routinely lands in 20–50+ territories thanks to Netflix, Prime, Disney+, etc. In short: the ceiling got much higher even if the floor stayed low.

### Genre Convergence Across Countries

Top genres per period show if preferences are converging (e.g., action/drama dominating globally).

```{r}
# Plot: Top 5 Genres by COVID Period - No extra packages
genre_converge_plot <- movies_clean |>
  unnest(genres_list) |>
  filter(!is.na(genres_list)) |>
  group_by(period, genres_list) |>
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") |>
  group_by(period) |>
  slice_max(count, n = 5) |>
  ungroup() |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(genres_list, count), y = count)) +  # Reorder by count (works per facet with free scales)
  geom_col(fill = "#666666") +  # Neutral gray
  facet_wrap(~period, scales = "free") +   # free_x and free_y = independent reorder + no shared scale issues
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 5 Genres by COVID Period",
    subtitle = "Shows if genres like action/drama are converging in popularity",
    x = "Genre",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(genre_converge_plot)
```

Across all three periods, the podium stays remarkably stable:

1.  Drama (forever champion)

2.  Comedy

3.  Thriller

4.  Documentary

5.  Horror / Action / Romance (trading places depending on the year)

There’s no dramatic convergence toward a single global taste. People still reach for the stories that speak to them locally, but the same handful of genres dominate everywhere proof that some human appetites are truly universal.

## Cross-Country Comparisons

### Hollywood goes crazy

![Mind Blown](https://media.giphy.com/media/UvWllmm27ZaNbRpv2n/giphy.gif){width="500px" fig-align="center"}

The pandemic was a stress test for the entire film industry and it passed with flying colors, albeit with a few scars.

Theatrical releases took a historic hit, but audiences never stopped watching, they simply migrated online.

Engagement metrics have stabilized, global distribution reach for commercial films has permanently expanded, and the fundamental things audiences love (drama, laughs, thrills) haven’t changed one bit.

Cinema didn’t die in 2020. It moved house, grew up, and went properly global.
