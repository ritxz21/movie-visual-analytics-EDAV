# Data

## Description
Our Dataset is the IMDb Non-Commercial Datasets (IMDb Datasets Page): a publicly available collection maintained by IMDb, a subsidiary of Amazon. These datasets are updated daily and distributed as compressed tab-separated value files (.tsv.gz). Each file represents a different aspect of the IMDb database, including:

- title.basics.tsv.gz: title IDs, release years, genres, runtime

- title.ratings.tsv.gz: IMDb user ratings and vote counts

- title.akas.tsv.gz: international title names and release regions

- title.principals.tsv.gz: information about cast and crew 

IMDb compiles this information from user submissions, production companies, distributors, and verified industry sources. User-generated ratings are continuously updated as viewers submit them on the IMDb platform. [link: https://datasets.imdbws.com/]

## Missing value analysis
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("missingValue1.jpeg")
```

- IDs, titles, and adult flag: completely filled, no issues.

- Release year: missing for ~108k movies, so we drop them (we need the year for decades and COVID periods).

- Runtime: missing for ~267k movies, we later remove anything missing or under 10 minutes.

- Genres: missing for ~78k movies, we keep these (they just get skipped in genre analysis).

- Ratings and votes: both missing for ~393k movies (no ratings yet), so we drop them entirely.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("missingValue2.jpeg")
```

Our cleaning steps: We handled missing data by removing

- Movies without a release year

- Movies with no ratings or votes

- Movies missing runtime or with runtime < 10 minutes

- Movies with fewer than 50 votes (cuts out super-noisy ones)

The result is a smaller but solid dataset of real, rated films, perfect for trustworthy insights on quality, audience trends, and global reach.
